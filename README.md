## 🛠️ Project Focus

My projects emphasize:
- Clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Thoughtful data modeling and API design
- Authentication, authorization, and secure workflows
- Practical debugging and real-world development patterns

Notable work includes **CLI-based systems**, **REST APIs**, and **full-stack applications** that prioritize correctness, maintainability, and clarity over unnecessary complexity.

#  🏗️ Project Architecture

Client (UI)
│
│  HTTP Requests (JSON)
▼
Frontend (React)
- Component-based UI
- Form handling & validation
- API consumption
│
▼
Backend (Flask / Python)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Authentication & authorization
- Business logic & validation
│
▼
Database (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Relational data models
- Migrations & schema control
- Data integrity constraints

#  Key Architectural Principles

Separation of concerns
Frontend handles presentation and user interaction, backend manages logic and data.

API-first design
Clear, consistent API contracts between frontend and backend.

Data modeling before implementation
Relationships and constraints are defined early to avoid brittle logic later.

Security-conscious workflows
Authentication and authorization guard sensitive operations.

Tooling for developer experience
Use of CLI tools, migrations, and environment management to support real-world workflows.

Example: Donor CLI (Backend-First Architecture)

CLI Layer: Click-based commands for user interaction

Service Layer: Business rules and validation

Persistence Layer: SQLAlchemy ORM + SQLite/PostgreSQL

Security Layer: User authentication for sensitive actions

This layered approach ensures each part of the system remains testable, readable, and easy to extend.

Why This Matters

I prioritize architecture that reflects real production systems, even in small projects.
This allows me to scale features confidently, debug efficiently, and collaborate effectively with other developers.


## 📌 About This Portfolio

This portfolio is a living project that evolves alongside my technical growth.  
It serves both as a showcase of completed work and a foundation for future experiments, including larger backend-driven systems and data-focused applications.
